; Exercise 1.25: Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to
; a lot of extra work in writing expmod. Aî€¹er all, she says,
; since we already know how to compute exponentials, we
; could have simply written
; (define (expmod base exp m)
;  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
; Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for ourfast prime tester? Explain.

(define (even? a) (= (remainder a 2) 0))
(define (square a) (* a a))
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder
          (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
          m))
        (else
         (remainder
          (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
          m))))

(define (fast-expt b n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 1)
        ((even? n) (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
        (else (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))

; Expmod with fast-expt directly applied in the code (only the first
; instance, then it gets called recusively.
; It can be observed that the remainder procedure is only called once,
; unlike in the original procedure where it gets called every time until
; the exponent is 0.

; This formula is important when understanding how the first program was developed
; (a x b) mod m = ((a mod m) x (b mod m)) mod m

; Both methods work the same, but the main difference is that using fast-exp the
; complete exponentiation is calculated. In the OG version however, the procedure
; remainder is applied every time, keeping the numbers to calculate the remainder
; with smaller.
